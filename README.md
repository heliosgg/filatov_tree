IDK what to print here. This is implementation of binary tree.  
This project visualizes intersection of two binary trees.  
Just type number to push and '1' to continue (or '0' to stop filling tree).  
In Config.h you can find everything to customize visual output.  

Sample input:
10 1 5 1 16 1 3 1 6 1 15 1 19 1 2 1 4 1 7 1 13 1 18 1 20 0  
10 1 2 1 19 1 4 1 15 1 20 0
